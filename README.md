# IntelRealSenseWebPlayer
Gesture Controlled 3D Web Video Player using Intel RealSense Camera. Navanetth Bodla and I implemented a prototype demo showcasing how the Intel RealSense Camera could be used to control video playback using hand gestures.   This video was quickly stitched together comprising multiple takes soley for purposes of showcasing a cool application that I worked on.   Code can be found here:  I used 3JS, Intel RealSense SDK, Javascript &amp; HTML. FYI, the RealSense Javascript SDK is outdated so if you try to deploy this app, it's up to you to refactor the code base.
