# IntelRealSenseWebPlayer
Gesture Controlled 3D Web Video Player using Intel RealSense Camera. Navanetth Bodla and I implemented a prototype demo showcasing how the Intel RealSense Camera could be used to control video playback using hand gestures.  

Video Demo Can be found here: https://youtu.be/1Y9e-qqi4e4

This video was quickly stitched together comprising multiple takes soley for purposes of showcasing a cool application that I worked on. I used 3JS, Intel RealSense SDK, Javascript &amp; HTML. FYI, the RealSense Javascript SDK is outdated so if you try to deploy this app, it's up to you to refactor the code base.

Happy Coding!
